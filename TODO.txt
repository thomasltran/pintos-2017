Functionality
 - Calibrate the lapic period using the PIT
 - Look at how to debug under KVM
 - Add Bochs support
 - All CPU backtrace w/o IPI
 - btthreadcpu 

Design:
 - Abstract the scheduler driver better. Most can actually just directly call the thread () 
   counterparts but that might be just way too confusing.
 - Load balancing tests can be refactored to reduce the code
 - Perl load balancing code can be refactored better. In particular the reading of CPU
   stats

Bugs/Possible bugs:

Documentation:
 - Docs for MP configuration, lapic, and ioapic
 - Code needs more docs
 - Doc on how to install the new qemu
 - configure with --prefix=/home/courses/cs3204/bin/
 - Doc for BSP and AP

Tests:
 - More unit tests for SMP work/base code 
 - Can we make balance-synch2 check idle ticks if we IPI during wakeup?

Code cleanup:
 - Standard comments
 - Undo eclipse refactoring

IRB
 - Self evaluation and questions for students
