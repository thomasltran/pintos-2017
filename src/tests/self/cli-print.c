/*
 * Note that code like
 *
 *          intr_disable_push();
 *          printf ();
 *
 * is not legal unless the console has been put in EMERGENCY_MODE.
 *
 * This is because otherwise the assertion in schedule that ncli == 1
 * fails.  However, it is this assertion that is wrong.  It's intended
 * to detect when more than one spinlock is mistakenly held when calling
 * schedule, but cpu->ncli may be > 1 for other reasons, such as disabling
 * interrupts, then calling schedule (perhaps indirectly via lock_acquire).
 *
 * This tests checks that the console separates printf() even when
 * in emergency mode.  Without this feature, kernel backtraces during
 * panics are impossible to read.
